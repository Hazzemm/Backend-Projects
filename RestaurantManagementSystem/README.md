# Restaurant Management System 

## Overview
The Restaurant Management System is a backend application designed to manage menu items, inventory, orders, reservations, and reports. It provides CRUD operations for managing essential restaurant data and automates inventory tracking when orders are placed. Additionally, the system generates daily reports for income and inventory consumption.
The application uses password hashing and JWT authentication and authorization allowing only admin to perform adjustments in the menu and inventory and get the daily report while user can only view the menu and order a menu item or a list of items specifying the quantity of each item
